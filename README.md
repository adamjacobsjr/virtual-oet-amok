# Virtual Pets Amok

I basically expanded the dino rescue center from the pet shelter project to now have dragons. this allowed for a seperate species ( cat / dog ) and some simularities. Though instead of walking the dogs its letting the dragons stretch their wings and fly. I imported a lot of the methods I used in previous projects and the same style of map and collection to keep things as streamlined as possible. 

I did change a few of the methods to work a little better. 

overall i am not really satisfied with the end result as the menu feels cumbersome and I didnt have time to rebuild the entire Application.java. Maybe thats good though. I will continue to think about changes i would make if I were to do it again. 

I also removed the exit artwork. 

Enjoy and try not to get eaten.
